## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First Approach
1. **Phase 1-2**: Complete setup and foundational infrastructure
2. **Phase 3**: Implement core admission functionality (User Story 1)
3. **Phase 4**: Add room viewing and filtering (User Story 2)
4. **Phase 5**: Implement discharge workflow (User Story 3)
5. **Incremental Delivery**: Add remaining user stories based on priority

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Backend Models (T001-T004)**:
```bash
# Can be implemented in parallel
T001: Create Room model
T002: Create Admission model  
T003: Create Room schemas
T004: Create Admission schemas
```

**API Endpoints (T010-T013)**:
```bash
# Can be implemented in parallel after models
T010: Rooms endpoint
T011: Admissions endpoint
T012: Room filtering
T013: Admission validation
```

**Frontend Components (T014-T017)**:
```bash
# Can be implemented in parallel after API
T014: RoomList component
T015: AdmissionForm component
T016: RoomApi service
T017: AdmissionApi service
```

### Independent Test Criteria

Each user story can be tested independently:

- **US1**: Create admission → Verify room status → Verify billing setup
- **US2**: Load rooms → Apply filters → Verify results
- **US3**: Select admission → Discharge → Verify billing → Verify room available
- **US4**: Load admissions → Filter active → Verify details
- **US5**: Select room → Change status → Verify exclusion/inclusion
