# Research: Patient Admission and Discharge Workflow

**Feature**: Patient Admission and Discharge Workflow  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns

## Database Design Research

### Decision: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
**Rationale**: Existing system uses PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy provides robust ORM with transaction support needed for concurrency control. Alembic handles migrations seamlessly.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Raw SQL: Too low-level, error-prone for complex queries
- Django ORM: Not compatible with existing FastAPI architecture
- NoSQL: Lacks ACID properties needed for financial transactions

### Decision: Optimistic Locking for Concurrency Control
**Rationale**: Prevents double booking by checking room status at transaction commit. Fails fast with clear error messages.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pessimistic locking: Could cause deadlocks with multiple room assignments
- Database constraints: Limited error messaging capabilities
- Application-level locks: Complex to implement across distributed systems

## API Design Research

### Decision: RESTful API with FastAPI
**Rationale**: FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI documentation, type safety with Pydantic, and excellent performance. RESTful design follows existing patterns.

**Alternatives considered**:
- GraphQL: Overkill for simple CRUD operations, adds complexity
- gRPC: Binary protocol not suitable for web frontend
- WebSockets: Real-time updates can be handled with polling/SSE

### Decision: WebSocket for Real-time Updates
**Rationale**: Provides immediate room status updates across user sessions without polling overhead.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-Sent Events: One-way communication insufficient for complex updates
- Polling: Inefficient, delays updates
- Push notifications: Not suitable for real-time operational data

## Frontend Architecture Research

### Decision: React with Material-UI Components
**Rationale**: Existing frontend uses React, Material-UI provides consistent healthcare-appropriate UI components with accessibility features.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom CSS: Time-consuming, inconsistent with existing design
- Other UI libraries: Material-UI already established in project
- Native components: Web application requires cross-platform compatibility

### Decision: Context API for State Management
**Rationale**: Simple state management for admission/room data. Redux would be overkill for this feature scope.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux: Complex setup for simple state management
- Zustand: Additional dependency not justified
- Local state: Insufficient for cross-component data sharing

## Billing Integration Research

### Decision: Direct Database Integration
**Rationale**: Existing billing system uses same database. Direct integration ensures data consistency and performance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- API integration: Additional network overhead, potential consistency issues
- Message queue: Overkill for synchronous billing requirements
- File-based integration: Complex, error-prone

### Decision: Transactional Billing Calculation
**Rationale**: Billing calculations must be atomic with admission/discharge operations to maintain financial accuracy.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Async billing: Risk of data inconsistency
- Batch processing: Delays in billing updates
- External service: Additional complexity, network dependencies

## Error Handling Research

### Decision: Structured Error Responses
**Rationale**: Consistent error format enables better user experience and debugging. HTTP status codes provide clear error categorization.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic errors: Poor user experience, difficult debugging
- Exception-only handling: Inconsistent error responses
- Log-only errors: No user feedback

## Performance Research

### Decision: Database Indexing Strategy
**Rationale**: Proper indexing on room status, admission dates, and patient IDs ensures sub-second query performance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- No indexing: Poor performance with large datasets
- Over-indexing: Slower writes, unnecessary complexity
- Caching: Additional complexity, potential consistency issues

### Decision: Connection Pooling
**Rationale**: SQLAlchemy connection pooling handles concurrent requests efficiently without overwhelming database.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single connection: Bottleneck for concurrent users
- Unlimited connections: Database resource exhaustion
- Custom pooling: Unnecessary complexity

## Security Research

### Decision: Role-based Access Control
**Rationale**: Healthcare data requires strict access controls. Existing authentication system provides foundation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- No access control: Security risk
- IP-based restrictions: Too restrictive for healthcare workflows
- Custom authentication: Reinventing existing system

### Decision: Input Validation with Pydantic
**Rationale**: Pydantic provides automatic validation, type safety, and clear error messages for malformed requests.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual validation: Error-prone, inconsistent
- Database-level validation: Poor error messages
- No validation: Security and data integrity risks

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Unit Tests for Business Logic
**Rationale**: Critical business logic (billing calculations, concurrency control) requires comprehensive unit testing.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Integration tests only: Slow feedback, complex setup
- No tests: Risk of production bugs
- E2E tests only: Slow, brittle, expensive to maintain

### Decision: Mock External Dependencies
**Rationale**: Isolated unit tests provide fast feedback and reliable test results.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Real database: Slow, flaky tests
- Test database: Complex setup, data management issues
- No mocking: Tests depend on external systems

## Implementation Patterns Research

### Decision: Service Layer Pattern
**Rationale**: Separates business logic from API endpoints, enables testing and reusability.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fat controllers: Business logic mixed with HTTP handling
- Anemic domain models: Logic scattered across application
- Microservices: Overkill for single feature

### Decision: Repository Pattern for Data Access
**Rationale**: Abstracts database operations, enables testing with mocks, provides consistent data access patterns.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct ORM usage: Tight coupling, difficult testing
- Active Record: Limited flexibility
- Data Mapper: Overkill for simple CRUD operations
