# Feature Specification: ETL Reporting System

**Feature Branch**: `004-etl-reporting-system`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add ETL (Pandas/SQLAlchemy) to aggregate invoices/payments into a reporting schema, run via python backend/etl.py or cron. Implement reports (revenue, patient histories, outstanding payments) via /api/v1/reports/* endpoints with RBAC. Create a /staff/reports dashboard with Recharts, filters, and WCAG-compliant UI (#4A90E2, #00BFA5 colors). Ensure HIPAA compliance with de-identified PHI, audit logging, and indexed queries for performance."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Revenue Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P1)

Staff members need to view comprehensive revenue reports to understand financial performance, track trends, and make informed business decisions.

**Why this priority**: Revenue reporting is the core business value of the system, enabling financial oversight and strategic planning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the revenue dashboard and verifying that financial data is accurately displayed with proper filtering and date range selection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a staff member is logged in with appropriate permissions, **When** they navigate to the reports dashboard, **Then** they can view revenue summaries by time period
2. **Given** revenue data exists in the system, **When** a staff member applies date filters, **Then** the revenue charts update to show data for the selected period
3. **Given** a staff member is viewing revenue reports, **When** they select different time granularities (daily, weekly, monthly), **Then** the charts adapt to show appropriate detail levels

---

### User Story 2 - Patient Payment History Reports (Priority: P2)

Staff members need to access patient payment histories to track individual payment patterns, identify trends, and provide customer service.

**Why this priority**: Patient payment tracking is essential for operational efficiency and customer relationship management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for a specific patient and verifying their complete payment history is displayed with proper privacy controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a staff member has patient access permissions, **When** they search for a patient by name or ID, **Then** they can view that patient's complete payment history
2. **Given** a patient has multiple payment records, **When** a staff member views their history, **Then** payments are displayed in chronological order with status indicators
3. **Given** a staff member is viewing patient payment data, **When** they apply filters for payment status or date ranges, **Then** the results are filtered appropriately while maintaining HIPAA compliance

---

### User Story 3 - Outstanding Payments Management (Priority: P2)

Staff members need to identify and manage outstanding payments to improve cash flow and reduce bad debt.

**Why this priority**: Outstanding payment management directly impacts revenue collection and business sustainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the outstanding payments report and verifying that overdue payments are properly identified and actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** there are invoices with outstanding balances, **When** a staff member views the outstanding payments report, **Then** they can see all overdue payments with aging information
2. **Given** a staff member is viewing outstanding payments, **When** they filter by amount range or days overdue, **Then** the results are filtered to show relevant payment collection opportunities
3. **Given** a staff member identifies an overdue payment, **When** they view payment details, **Then** they can see the patient contact information and payment history for follow-up actions

---

### User Story 4 - Automated Data Processing (Priority: P3)

The system needs to automatically aggregate and process invoice and payment data to maintain accurate reporting information.

**Why this priority**: Automated data processing ensures reports are always current and reduces manual data maintenance overhead.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the ETL process and verifying that aggregated data is correctly updated in the reporting schema.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new invoice and payment data exists, **When** the ETL process runs, **Then** the reporting schema is updated with the latest aggregated information
2. **Given** the ETL process encounters data inconsistencies, **When** it processes the data, **Then** errors are logged and the process continues with valid data
3. **Given** the system is running scheduled ETL processes, **When** a process fails, **Then** administrators are notified and the process can be manually triggered

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no payments in a selected date range?
- How does the system handle patients with no payment history?
- What occurs when ETL processing fails due to database connectivity issues? (System stops and alerts administrators)
- How are large datasets handled during report generation?
- What happens when a user's session expires while viewing reports?
- How does the system handle concurrent ETL processes?
- What occurs when report data becomes stale due to ETL failures?
