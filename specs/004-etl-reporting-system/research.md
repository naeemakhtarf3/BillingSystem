# Research: ETL Reporting System

**Feature**: 004-etl-reporting-system  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation approach

## Research Findings

### ETL Data Processing Architecture

**Decision**: Use Pandas for data transformation with SQLAlchemy for database operations

**Rationale**: 
- Pandas provides efficient data manipulation for large datasets (10,000+ records)
- SQLAlchemy ensures database compatibility and transaction safety
- Existing project already uses SQLAlchemy, maintaining consistency
- Pandas integrates well with SQLAlchemy for ETL workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- Raw SQL: More complex for data transformations, less maintainable
- Apache Airflow: Overkill for simple scheduled ETL, adds complexity
- Custom Python scripts: Pandas provides better performance and features

### Reporting Schema Design

**Decision**: Implement star schema with fact tables and dimension tables

**Rationale**:
- Star schema optimizes for analytical queries and report generation
- Pre-aggregated metrics enable fast report response times (2-second target)
- Supports complex filtering and time-based analysis
- Industry standard for data warehousing and reporting

**Alternatives considered**:
- Normalized schema: Slower query performance for reports
- Flat tables: Limited scalability and flexibility
- NoSQL: SQL-based reporting tools work better with relational schemas

### HIPAA Compliance Implementation

**Decision**: Implement partial de-identification with patient ID retention

**Rationale**:
- Balances HIPAA compliance with operational utility
- Patient ID allows staff to identify patients for follow-up actions
- Removes direct identifiers (name, SSN) to meet privacy requirements
- Maintains referential integrity for business operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full de-identification: Would eliminate operational utility
- No de-identification: Violates HIPAA requirements
- Tokenization: Adds complexity without clear benefit

### PDF Export Implementation

**Decision**: Use ReportLab for PDF generation with templated reports

**Rationale**:
- ReportLab provides professional PDF generation capabilities
- Supports complex layouts and charts for reports
- Integrates well with Python backend
- Maintains consistent formatting across all reports

**Alternatives considered**:
- WeasyPrint: Limited chart support, HTML-based approach
- Matplotlib: Primarily for charts, not full document generation
- External services: Adds dependency and cost

### ETL Scheduling Strategy

**Decision**: Use cron for ETL scheduling with Python script execution

**Rationale**:
- Simple and reliable scheduling mechanism
- Easy to monitor and debug
- Standard approach for batch processing
- Integrates well with existing infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Celery: Adds complexity for simple scheduling needs
- APScheduler: More features than needed for basic scheduling
- Manual execution: Not suitable for automated requirements

### Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Stop and alert administrators on ETL failures

**Rationale**:
- Prevents data corruption from partial processing
- Ensures data integrity is maintained
- Clear failure notification enables quick resolution
- Simple and reliable error handling approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Retry with backoff: Could mask underlying issues
- Continue with partial data: Risk of data inconsistency
- Automatic recovery: Complex and potentially unreliable

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Implement database indexing and query optimization

**Rationale**:
- Database indexes provide fastest query performance
- Supports concurrent user access (50 users target)
- Enables sub-2-second query response times
- Standard approach for reporting systems

**Alternatives considered**:
- Caching: Adds complexity, data freshness concerns
- Read replicas: Overkill for current scale
- NoSQL: SQL-based reporting tools work better with relational data

### Frontend Charting Library

**Decision**: Use Recharts for data visualization

**Rationale**:
- Recharts provides React-native charting components
- Supports interactive charts and filtering
- Integrates well with Material-UI design system
- Good performance for large datasets

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chart.js: Not React-native, requires more integration work
- D3.js: Too low-level, requires more development time
- Victory: Less mature ecosystem compared to Recharts

### WCAG Compliance Implementation

**Decision**: Use Material-UI components with custom color scheme

**Rationale**:
- Material-UI components include built-in accessibility features
- Custom color scheme (#4A90E2, #00BFA5) maintains brand consistency
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through component design
- Consistent accessibility across all report components

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom components: More development time, accessibility concerns
- Other UI libraries: Material-UI provides best accessibility support
- No accessibility considerations: Violates requirements

## Implementation Approach

Based on research findings, the implementation will follow:

1. **Backend-First**: Python FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy models
2. **ETL Processing**: Pandas-based data transformation with cron scheduling
3. **Reporting Schema**: Star schema design for optimal query performance
4. **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with RBAC authentication
5. **Frontend**: React components with Material-UI and Recharts
6. **Compliance**: HIPAA de-identification and WCAG accessibility
7. **Performance**: Database indexing and query optimization
8. **Error Handling**: Stop-and-alert approach for ETL failures
