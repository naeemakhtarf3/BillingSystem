# Research: Invoice Status Filter

**Feature**: Invoice Status Filter  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Analysis

## Technology Decisions

### Client-Side Filtering Implementation

**Decision**: Use React state management with array filtering methods  
**Rationale**: Client-side filtering provides immediate response, reduces server load, and meets the requirement for sub-2-second response times. No backend changes needed.  
**Alternatives considered**: Server-side filtering (rejected due to complexity and performance requirements)

### State Persistence Method

**Decision**: localStorage API for filter state persistence  
**Rationale**: localStorage provides simple, reliable persistence across browser sessions without requiring backend storage or URL parameter management. Meets the requirement for 100% persistence across page reloads.  
**Alternatives considered**: URL parameters (rejected due to complexity), sessionStorage (rejected due to session-only persistence)

### UI Component Library

**Decision**: Material-UI Select component for dropdown  
**Rationale**: Material-UI is already established in the project per constitution. Select component provides accessible dropdown functionality with consistent styling.  
**Alternatives considered**: Custom dropdown (rejected due to accessibility concerns), other UI libraries (rejected due to constitution requirements)

### Filter State Management

**Decision**: React useState hook with localStorage integration  
**Rationale**: useState provides simple state management for this single-component feature. localStorage integration ensures persistence without complex state management libraries.  
**Alternatives considered**: Redux (rejected due to over-engineering), Context API (rejected due to single-component scope)

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Array.filter() method with memoization for large datasets  
**Rationale**: Array.filter() provides efficient client-side filtering. For datasets up to 1000 invoices, performance is acceptable. Memoization can be added if needed for larger datasets.  
**Alternatives considered**: Virtual scrolling (rejected due to complexity), pagination (rejected due to UX requirements)

## Implementation Patterns

### Component Structure
- Single StatusFilterDropdown component
- Props: invoices array, onFilterChange callback
- State: selectedFilter (string)
- Methods: handleFilterChange, loadFromStorage, saveToStorage

### Filtering Logic
- Filter function: invoices.filter(invoice => invoice.status === selectedFilter || selectedFilter === 'all')
- Immediate application on state change
- No debouncing needed for this use case

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable
- Default to 'all' filter if invalid state detected
- Console warning for localStorage errors

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required Dependencies
- Material-UI Select component (already available)
- React useState hook (built-in)
- localStorage API (built-in)

### No Additional Dependencies
- No external libraries needed
- No backend changes required
- No database modifications needed

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Filtering Performance
- Array.filter() performance: O(n) where n = number of invoices
- Expected performance: <100ms for 1000 invoices
- Memory usage: Minimal (only filtered array reference)

### localStorage Performance
- Read/write operations: <1ms
- Storage size: <1KB for filter state
- No performance impact on page load

## Accessibility Considerations

### Material-UI Select Accessibility
- Built-in ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

### Filter State Accessibility
- Clear visual indication of active filter
- Consistent labeling
- No hidden state changes

## Browser Compatibility

### localStorage Support
- Supported in all modern browsers
- Graceful degradation if unavailable
- No polyfills needed

### React 18.2.0 Support
- Compatible with all target browsers
- No additional browser requirements
- Standard ES6+ features used
