# Feature Specification: Invoice Status Filter

**Feature Branch**: `001-invoice-status-filter`  
**Created**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add Status Filter to Invoices Management Screen"

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-01-15

- Q: Which persistence method should be used for the filter state? â†’ A: localStorage only - simpler implementation, better UX for UI state

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Filter Invoices by Status (Priority: P1)

Staff members need to quickly filter the invoices table to view only invoices with specific statuses (paid, issued, or all) to improve workflow efficiency and focus on relevant invoices.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables staff to manage their workflow by focusing on specific invoice states, which is essential for daily operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting different filter options and verifying that only matching invoices are displayed, delivering immediate value for invoice management workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the invoices management screen is open with all invoices displayed, **When** a staff member selects "Paid" from the status filter, **Then** only invoices with "paid" status are shown
2. **Given** the invoices management screen is open with all invoices displayed, **When** a staff member selects "Issued" from the status filter, **Then** only invoices with "issued" status are shown
3. **Given** the invoices management screen is open with filtered results, **When** a staff member selects "All" from the status filter, **Then** all invoices are displayed regardless of status

### User Story 2 - Persist Filter Selection (Priority: P2)

Staff members need their filter selection to be remembered when they return to the invoices screen or refresh the page to maintain their workflow context.

**Why this priority**: This improves user experience by maintaining the staff member's preferred view state, reducing the need to re-select filters frequently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a filter, navigating away and back, or refreshing the page, and verifying the filter selection is maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a staff member has selected "Paid" filter, **When** they navigate to another page and return to invoices, **Then** the "Paid" filter is still selected
2. **Given** a staff member has selected "Issued" filter, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the "Issued" filter is still selected and the filtered results are maintained

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Empty Filter Results (Priority: P3)

Staff members need clear feedback when their filter selection results in no matching invoices to understand why no data is displayed.

**Why this priority**: This prevents confusion when filters return empty results and helps staff understand the current state of their invoice data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a filter that results in no matches and verifying that an appropriate message is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the invoices management screen is open, **When** a staff member selects "Paid" filter but no paid invoices exist, **Then** a "No invoices match this filter" message is displayed
2. **Given** the invoices management screen is open, **When** a staff member selects "Issued" filter but no issued invoices exist, **Then** a "No invoices match this filter" message is displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the filter is applied while data is still loading?
- How does the system handle rapid filter changes?
- What happens when the filter selection is invalid or corrupted in storage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a status filter dropdown with options "All", "Paid", and "Issued"
- **FR-002**: System MUST filter invoice data client-side based on selected status
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist filter selection across page reloads and navigation
- **FR-004**: System MUST display "No invoices match this filter" message when filter returns no results
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain filter state during data loading operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply filter immediately upon selection without requiring additional user action
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle filter persistence using localStorage
- **FR-008**: System MUST style the filter to match the existing blue theme and table layout

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Invoice**: Represents a billing document with attributes including invoice number, patient, status (paid/issued), amount, and issued date
- **Filter State**: Represents the current filter selection and persistence mechanism

### Frontend Components *(include if feature has UI)*

- **StatusFilterDropdown**: A dropdown component that displays filter options and handles selection changes
- **InvoiceTable**: The existing table component that displays filtered invoice data
- **NoResultsMessage**: A component that displays when no invoices match the selected filter

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Staff can filter invoices by status in under 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Filter selection persists across 100% of page reloads and navigation events
- **SC-003**: System displays appropriate feedback for empty filter results in under 1 second
- **SC-004**: Filter functionality works correctly with datasets containing up to 1000 invoices
- **SC-005**: Staff can switch between filter options without page refresh or data reload
