# Implementation Plan: Invoice Status Filter

**Branch**: `001-invoice-status-filter` | **Date**: 2024-01-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-invoice-status-filter/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Add a status filter dropdown to the invoices management screen that allows staff to filter invoices by status (All, Paid, Issued) with client-side filtering, localStorage persistence, and Material-UI styling. This feature improves workflow efficiency by enabling staff to focus on specific invoice states without requiring backend API changes.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: React 18.2.0, JavaScript ES6+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Material-UI, React Context API, localStorage API  
**Storage**: localStorage for filter state persistence  
**Testing**: No test cases (per constitution)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend component)  
**Performance Goals**: Filter response under 2 seconds, support up to 1000 invoices  
**Constraints**: Client-side filtering only, Material-UI styling required, localStorage persistence  
**Scale/Scope**: Single component feature, minimal dependencies, clean code standards

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Backend-First**: All business logic MUST be implemented in Python backend
- **Component-Based**: Frontend features MUST be separate React components
- **Material-UI**: All frontend styling MUST use Material-UI components
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each dependency MUST be justified
- **Clean Code**: Code MUST be readable and well-documented
- **No Tests**: Test cases are explicitly excluded from this project

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected. This feature is a frontend-only component that will be added to the existing React frontend. The backend remains unchanged as this feature uses client-side filtering only.

## Phase 0: Research Complete ✅

**Research Artifacts Generated**:
- `research.md` - Technology decisions and implementation patterns
- Client-side filtering approach selected
- localStorage persistence method chosen
- Material-UI component integration planned

## Phase 1: Design Complete ✅

**Design Artifacts Generated**:
- `data-model.md` - Entity definitions and data flow
- `contracts/api-contract.md` - Frontend component interface
- `quickstart.md` - Implementation guide and examples
- Agent context updated for Cursor IDE

## Constitution Check - Post Design ✅

*Re-evaluated after Phase 1 design*

- **Backend-First**: ✅ No backend changes required (client-side filtering)
- **Component-Based**: ✅ Single StatusFilterDropdown component
- **Material-UI**: ✅ Material-UI Select component used
- **Minimal Dependencies**: ✅ No additional dependencies required
- **Clean Code**: ✅ Simple, focused component design
- **No Tests**: ✅ No test cases included per constitution

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitution violations detected*

This feature is a simple frontend component with minimal complexity:
- Single React component
- Client-side filtering only
- localStorage persistence
- No backend changes required
- No additional dependencies
